In this and subsequent posts we will talking about data structures, their usage and how to implement them in various programming languages. So let's get started.


Data Structures are very fundamental and basic concept of Computer Science. They are basically a way to store data in computer to perform certain operation efficietly on it. To make this idea more concrete let's look at an example which shows usage of data structure in real life.


Consider a library where books are arranged in random manner. To search a book you will require to check each book in the library which can be quite daunting if library is huge. To Solve this problem we could arrange books according to their genre and in each genre arranging them in alphabetical order. This arrangement  is an example of dictionary data structure with each key being the genre type and value containing the sorted list of books.

Data Structures can be mainly classified in two categories:
1. Linear 
2. Non Linear 


* Linear Data Structure organize the data element in a manner, where each data element attaches one after the other. In linear data Structure, the data elements traverse one after the other and only one element can be directly reached while traversing. Exmaples of linear data structure are Arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queue.

* In non-linear data structure, the organization of data elementsis not in sequential fashion. It is possible to attach a data item to several other data item to specify certain relationship among them. Examples of non-linear data structure are Tree, Graph.

So thats it for the introduction to data stuctures. In next post will look at array data structure.
